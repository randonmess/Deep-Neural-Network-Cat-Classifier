# Deep-Neural-Network-Cat-Classifier
Building a neural network class with NumPy and implementing to make a deep NN cat classifier.

## C1W4A1
`C1W4A1` contains the Jupyter Notebook and supporting files for coding the neural network class.
### Objectives
- Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
- Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
- Implement an easy-to-use neural network class

## C1W4A2
`C1W4A2` contains the Jupyter Notebook and supporting files for implementing the NN class to build a cat classifier model.
### Objectives
- Build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and apply it to supervised learning
